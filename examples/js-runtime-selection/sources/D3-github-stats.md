## Analysis Notes

- Node.js has the most stars (115K) and overwhelmingly most forks (34K), reflecting its long history and massive contributor base
- Deno has 106K stars — impressive for a newer runtime, likely boosted by Ryan Dahl's reputation and the "Node.js successor" narrative
- Bun has 87K stars despite being the youngest (v1.0 only Sep 2023) — the fastest star accumulation rate of the three
- Bun's open issues count (6,066) is notably high relative to its age, suggesting rapid development but also many unresolved edge cases
- Node.js forks (34K) dwarfs both Deno (5.9K) and Bun (4.1K), indicating much deeper enterprise/community fork activity
