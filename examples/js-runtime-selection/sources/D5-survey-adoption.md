## State of JavaScript 2024 — Runtime Usage

| Runtime | Usage Rate | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Node.js | 94% | Most popular runtime (surpassed browsers at 83%) |
| Bun | 23% | Remarkable for a project reaching v1.0 only in Sep 2023 |
| Deno | ~15-18% | Steady but not growing as fast as Bun |

## Adoption Trajectory

- **Node.js**: Mature, near-universal adoption. 94% usage means nearly every JS developer has used it.
- **Bun**: Fastest-growing runtime. From 0% (pre-2022) to 23% in ~2 years. "Astounding" growth rate per survey commentary.
- **Deno**: Steady but overshadowed by Bun's meteoric rise. Deno 2.0 (Oct 2024) improved npm compatibility significantly.

## Production Usage Indicators

| Signal | Node.js | Deno | Bun |
|--------|---------|------|-----|
| Stack Overflow questions | 475,028 | 1,105 | 264 |

| Enterprise adoption | Very high (Netflix, PayPal, LinkedIn, Uber) | Growing (Slack, Netlify) | Early (some startups) |
| Cloud provider support | All major providers | Deno Deploy + others | Limited native support |

## Developer Sentiment (from survey commentary)

- Node.js: "Reliable workhorse" — trusted in production, but seen as aging
- Deno: "Security-first alternative" — respected, but adoption slower than expected
- Bun: "Speed demon" — excitement about performance, concern about production readiness
- Key quote from State of JS 2024: "Node.js is now a more popular runtime than web browsers"
